# pi-workflow

Custom workflow runtime for [Pi](https://pi.dev).

This repository contains the durable static execution core and Pi extension for
trusted read-only agent workflows, durable deterministic support-task
execution, and bounded nested static workflows executed as linked child runs.
Dynamic workflows, writer tasks, retry/resume, and polished UI remain
unavailable.

## Goal

Provide one reusable workflow engine with:

- trusted TypeScript workflow authoring and a later bounded dynamic frontend;
- typed task/artifact handles that materialize a declarative durable graph;
- stable tasks, explicit order/data dependencies, parallelism, pipelines,
  bounded fan-out/fan-in, and bounded nested workflows;
- schema-validated agent results and deterministic support tasks;
- declared cost/runtime budgets, optional total-token guards, and durable
  wall-clock deadlines;
- append-only lifecycle state, leases, fencing, resume, retry, replay, and
  reconciliation;
- fail-closed persistence, required finalizers, and bounded UI;
- physical child execution delegated to the exact extension-owned
  `SubagentService`.

shared pi-subagent service (agent tasks)
in-process support executor (support tasks)
linked child workflow run (nested workflow tasks)
```

Workflows without result-dependent branches can materialize their complete DAG
before execution. Data-dependent workflows materialize the same graph
incrementally across explicit result barriers.

`pi-workflow` owns orchestration. It does not spawn private child runtimes or
own publication, push, pull-request, merge, release, or deployment policy.

## Dependency

[`pi-subagent`](https://github.com/vegardx/pi-subagent) owns every physical
agent run and attempt. Its extension registers a lazy provider on Pi's event bus.
Workflow acquires that exact service through the public typed provider export,
checks the exact runtime contract, and never constructs or shuts down a second
execution service.

## Pi tools

The packaged extension registers:

```text
workflow_list      workflow_validate  workflow_run
workflow_status    workflow_wait      workflow_stop
workflow_reconcile
```

`workflow_run` returns a durable run ID immediately. Use `workflow_wait` for the
bounded result or `workflow_stop` to persist stop intent, abort in-process
support work, and drain active child work.

## Support tasks

Trusted packages define typed descriptor helpers with `defineSupportTask` and
pass the matching `helper.registration(execute)` objects to
`createWorkflowService({ supportTasks })`. Workflows declare them with
`ctx.support(key, helper({ parameters, inputs }))`. The runtime resolves each
persisted descriptor against that constructor registry by exact implementation
identity, runs the implementation in the host process without a subagent,
model, VM, or worktree, and commits the output as a workflow-owned artifact.
The public entry points are `createWorkflowSupportTaskExecutor`,
`supportRegistrationIdentity`, `deriveSupportImplementationIdentitySha256`,
`SupportTaskExecutionRecordSchema`, and `SupportTaskTerminalEvidenceSchema`;
see [Contracts](docs/contracts.md#support-task-execution).

## Nested workflows

A workflow can run another discovered workflow as a linked child run:

```ts
export default defineWorkflow({
	meta: {
		name: "nest-parent",
		description: "Parent",
		version: 1,
		budget: { cost: 5, childRuntimeMs: 120_000 },
		timeoutMs: 600_000,
	},
	inputSchema: InputSchema,
	outputSchema: OutputSchema,
	run(ctx) {
		const task = ctx.agent("draft", {
			agent: "researcher",
			task: { goal: "Draft the document", context: [], instructions: [] },
			contextMode: "fresh",
			tools: ["read"],
			preloadSkills: [],
			contextScopes: ["project"],
			workspace: { mode: "read-only", cwd: ctx.cwd },
			limits: limits.readOnly,
			outputSchema: DocSchema,
		});
		return ctx.workflow("child", {
			workflow: "echo-child",
			input: { value: ctx.input.value },
			inputs: { doc: task.output },
		});
	},
});
```

The child is resolved by name from the same discovery pass and trust gate as
the parent. Its identity, source digest, schemas, budget, timeout, and
concurrency are captured at declaration together with the authored `input`
and any named artifact `inputs`, and the task is lowered into a
`kind: "workflow"` record. Artifact inputs follow the merged-input rule: each
producer becomes an order dependency, the authored `input` must be an object
without a key equal to an input name, and at launch every verified artifact
value is merged into it as a top-level key (`{ value, doc }` above), validated
against the child's input schema and the 900 KiB bound, and launched as the
child's plain `ctx.input`. Without artifact inputs the authored input is
validated at declaration. Execution launches a separate durable run with its
own journal, lease, artifact store, and subagent owner binding; the parent
reserves the child's declared budget, caps the child's deadline at its own,
records the injected artifact identities in the child's run record, and
imports the child's verified output as a parent-owned artifact before the task
completes. Depth is bounded at 0 through 3, a run may declare at most 64
workflow tasks, and recursion along the ancestor chain is rejected. The public
entry points are `createWorkflowNestedRunExecutor`,
`deriveNestedWorkflowRunId`, `NestedWorkflowTaskSpecSchema`,
`NestedWorkflowInputArtifactsSchema`, `NestedWorkflowTerminalEvidenceSchema`,
and `MAX_NESTED_WORKFLOW_DEPTH`; see
[Contracts](docs/contracts.md#nested-workflow-tasks).

## Development

Until `@vegardx/pi-subagent` is published, development resolves it from the
sibling `../pi-subagent` checkout. CI checks out the exact qualified commit and
builds it before running:

```text
npm run check
```
